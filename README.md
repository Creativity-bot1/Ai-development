# Ai-development

two different projects both consiting of training an ai model on databses.

1) project A which was done in my final year project wa training multiple machine learning algorithms on a network security database with the aim of seeing if i could use AI to increase the accuracy of an Intrusion detecetion system . the models used were random forest , decisoon tree , nerua network and multi-layered perception a sub of neural network .
2) project B is simailar becuasei  used one of the mentioned machine learning algorithms but instead was training on a dataset on transport.
